# Multimodal-models-for-predicting-drug-target-interactions

The Master's thesis focuses on the design, implementation, and evaluation of advanced multimodal deep learning models for predicting Drug–Target Interactions (DTI). The objective is to investigate how the integration of diverse information sources—such as chemical structure of compounds (SMILES, molecular graphs), protein sequence and structural data, gene expression profiles, transcriptomic signatures, and clinical data—can enhance the efficacy and generalizability of predictive models.

The research will encompass the analysis and comparison of state-of-the-art architectures, including Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Transformers, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for biological sequence representation, and hybrid data fusion approaches like cross-modal attention mechanisms, late/early fusion, and dynamic modality aggregation. Improved variants of these methods will also be proposed, leveraging domain knowledge from chemoinformatics and bioinformatics, including biological ontologies, ligand activity profiles, and protein homology data.

Experiments will be conducted on benchmark datasets such as BindingDB, DrugBank, and KEGG Drug, as well as datasets extended with public data from initiatives like LINCS and ChEMBL. The evaluation will assess not only classification accuracy (e.g., AUC, F1-score) but also the models' ability to predict interactions for novel chemical and protein classes (cold-start scenarios). Additionally, the analysis will include the impact of input feature selection, representation extraction methods, and modality fusion strategies on the final results.

The conclusions of the thesis are intended to contribute to increasing the efficiency of early drug discovery stages, enabling better identification of promising therapeutic candidates, reducing preclinical research costs, and accelerating the process of translating basic research findings into clinical practice.
